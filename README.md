### 🙋‍♂️ Who i am?: 
 A full stack web developer recently graduated from Henry's intensive and challenging bootcamp, fully ready to accept new challenges that make me give 100% of myself.
  Fully aware that our IT world is a _life long learning_!
 
### 👩🏻‍💻 My current technology stack:
- Javascript 
- React 
- Redux
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSql
- Sequelize
- GitHub
- GIT
- HTML
- CSS
- learning MongoDB, VUE
- and open to learn more!

### ❣ How i am:
 I am a little embarrassed to define myself as a pleasant, empathic, proactive person... What I can say is that you can **always** expect kindness, a smile and above all the best vibes from me.
 In addition to always being willing to collaborate, investigate, interpret, propose, and everything that is needed to elevate the company, project or group 🚀
